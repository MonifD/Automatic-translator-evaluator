# Automatic-translator-evaluator

In the DATA folder you have two subfolders, one origin and the other trad, in the origin you put a text file which contains the text translated by a human into the desired language, and in the trad folder you put all the text translated by automatic translators.

## once this is done

You can run the evaluator.py code which is in the Prog folder
You then run the graph.py code to draw a graph of your results

If you want you can see the results in Json format in the result folder, the more the results tend to 0 the more the original text is similar to the text translated by the automatic translator.
